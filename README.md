# CVE-2023-23397
CVE-2023-23397 Remediation Script (Powershell)

There are 3 files.
If your patch management software uses an evaluation and a remediation script, those files are for that.

Alternatively, if you wish to just push out the update without the above, the All In One script will evaluate the current version of Microsoft Office and if it is not one of the patch versions, it will force an update.
