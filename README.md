# CVE-2023-23397
CVE-2023-23397 Remediation Script (Powershell)

There are 3 files.

If your patch management software uses an evaluation and a remediation script, use the respective files/scripts.

Alternatively, if you wish to just push out the update without the above, the All In One script will evaluate the current version of Microsoft Office and if it is not one of the patch versions, it will force an update.

The all in one script can be run manually or pushed out directly to the endpoint. It will not run (and thus not force close Office if the version of Windows is equal to the patch version).
